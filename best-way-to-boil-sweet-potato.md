🍠 Best Way to Boil Sweet Potatoes
✅ Ingredients:
Sweet potatoes (any variety: orange, white, yellow, or purple)

Water

Salt (optional)

🔪 Preparation:
Wash Thoroughly:

Scrub the sweet potatoes well under running water to remove dirt. You can boil them with or without skin.

Peel (Optional):

You can peel them if you prefer a softer texture or plan to mash them.

Leaving the skin on adds fiber and holds the shape better.

Cut into Even Pieces:

Slice into chunks or rounds, about 1½ to 2 inches thick. Even pieces ensure even cooking.

🍳 Boiling Instructions:
Place in Pot:

Put the sweet potato pieces in a large pot.

Cover with Cold Water:

Add enough water to cover the pieces by at least 1 inch.

Add Salt (Optional):

About ½ to 1 tsp of salt for flavor.

Boil:

Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to medium.

Boil gently for 15–20 minutes or until fork-tender (a fork should slide in easily).

Drain:

Pour off the hot water and let them sit for a minute to steam dry.

🥄 Serving Ideas:
Serve plain, with a little butter or coconut oil

Sprinkle with cinnamon or nutmeg for a touch of flavor

Great alongside saltfish, callaloo, steamed cabbage, or eggs
