Best Way to Boil Green Bananas
‚úÖ Ingredients:
Green bananas (as many as you need, typically 2‚Äì4 per person)

Water

Salt (optional, about 1 tsp per pot)

A little oil (optional, helps reduce the sticky sap)

üç≥ Instructions:
Wash the Bananas:

Rinse the green bananas under running water to remove dirt and sap.

Cut the Ends:

Trim both ends of each banana with a knife.

Score the Skin (Optional but Helpful):

Run a shallow slit lengthwise along the banana (don‚Äôt cut too deep). This helps the skin peel off easily after boiling.

Boil Water:

Fill a large pot with enough water to cover the bananas.

Add a little salt and a teaspoon of oil (optional).

Add Bananas:

Place the bananas (with skin on) into the boiling water.

Boil for 15‚Äì20 Minutes:

Boil until the bananas are tender. You can check by poking with a fork‚Äîif it goes in easily, they‚Äôre ready.

Drain and Cool:

Remove from the pot and let them cool slightly.

Peel and serve.

ü•Ñ Serving Suggestions:
Serve with callaloo, ackee and saltfish, boiled eggs, or avocado.

You can drizzle with olive oil or eat with a bit of butter for extra flavor.

Let me know if you want a variation (e.g., peeled before boiling or boiled with skin removed).
